Download: https://github.com/ReignOfComputer/JavaTestCenter/releases

Quick program for testing simple .java programs. Expects Java to be in System PATH, use [JavaPather](https://github.com/ReignOfComputer/JavaPather) if not. Takes in a .java file, compiles (-cp) and runs it, optionally takes in input and output and compares.

For a very specific use-case #CS2030 #CS2040.
